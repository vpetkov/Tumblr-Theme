This is a Tumblr theme with two columns. Main (content column is centerd and on the right is the sidebar containing shared items from google reader and a search field. At the top of the page is a nav bar with about, archive, etc, tumblr premade links and after them are appended user's pages. Description is hidden for now and the title is big. Previous/Next nav links are renamed to Older/Newer and on the permalink pages the blog title is replaced with the post title and above the footer (if any) is placed an optional attribution text, e.g. Written by..
